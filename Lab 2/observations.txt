Description: Observations

Step 3: Running ./two_process produces a seg fault because it is missing an argument

Step 4:
1) 500μs - program finishes in less than half a second
2) 5000μs - program takes much longer to run (not that long but compared to first delay it is 10x slow)

Step 6: Gives a seg fault because it is missing an argument, works if μs argument is given.
